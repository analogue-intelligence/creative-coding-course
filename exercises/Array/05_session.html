            <h2>5.1 Arrays</h2>
            <div>
                  <h3>5.1.1 Creating multiple variables</h3>
                  <p>Create 3 circles all having x-position 50, and radius 25 (maybe create variables for these values), but create a variable called yPos1, yPos2, yPos3 for each circle.</p>
                  <script type="text/p5" src="01.js" data-autoplay></script>
                  <br> <b class="pink">Note: </b> Is there any way you can reduce the number of variables? Yes you can use an array. Create an array called yPos and define it as follows yPos = [20, 50, 80]
            </div>

            <div>
                  <h3>5.1.2 Array Indexing</h3>
                  <p>From the example above, replace the variables yPos1, yPos2, yPos3 with the array yPos. An array is accessed as follows yPos[i] where i is the index. 
                        <br> <b class="pink">Note: </b> i is the index location in the array and an array starts its index from 0, so yPos[0] refers to the first element in the array yPos.</p>
                  <script type="text/p5" src="02.js" data-autoplay></script>
            </div>

            <div>
                  <h3>5.1.3 Accessing arrays quickly</h3>
                  <p>One still has to write down each circle for each element in the array, would you write down 50 circles if you had 50 elements in the array? That is not very feasible so we should use another way, we can use loops. 
                        Try and use a for loop to create a circle for each element in the array. <br> <b class="pink">Note: </b> to get the length of an array you can use arr.length</p>
                  <script type="text/p5" src="03.js" data-autoplay></script>
            </div>

            <div>
                  <h3>5.1.4 Foreach function</h3>
                  <p>Just as we did in example 5.1.3, however now intead of using a for loop, try using forEach to access every element in the array.</p>
                  <script type="text/p5" src="04.js" data-autoplay></script>
            </div>

            <div>
                  <h3>5.1.5 Sorting function</h3>
                  <p>Continuing on from example 5.1.4, define the yPos array as follows yPos = [50, 80, 20], sort the array using the sort() function before running the foreach on the yPos array</p>
                  <script type="text/p5" src="05.js" data-autoplay></script>
                  <p>What happened? Nothing visually, but the array has been sorted and if you print yPos before (in the setup() function) and after (in the draw() function) the sort you should see the arrays having a different ordering. 
                        This is a good function to keep in mind when you need to sort data</p>
            </div>
