            <h2>5.1 Arrays</h2>
            <div>
                  <h3>5.1.1 Creating multiple variables</h3>
                  <p>Create 3 circles all having x-position 50, and radius 25 (maybe create variables for these values), but create a variable called yPos1, yPos2, yPos3 for each circle. Is there any way you can reduce the number of variables? Yes you can use an array. Create an array called yPos and define it as follows yPos = [20, 50, 80]</p>
                  <script type="text/p5" src="01.js" data-autoplay></script>
            </div>

            <div>
                  <h3>5.1.2 Array Indexing</h3>
                  <p>From the example above, replace the variables yPos1, yPos2, yPos3 with the array yPos. An array is accessed as follows yPos[i] where i is the index. 
                        Note that i is the index location in the array. Also note that an array starts its index from 0, so yPos[0] refers to the first element in the array yPos.</p>
                  <script type="text/p5" src="02.js" data-autoplay></script>
            </div>

            <div>
                  <h3>5.1.3 Accessing arrays quickly</h3>
                  <p>One still has to write down each circle for each element in the array, would you write down 50 circles if you had 50 elements in the array? That is not very feasible so we should use another way, we can use loops. 
                        Try and use a for loop to create a circle for each element in the array. Note to get the length of an array you can use arr.length</p>
