            <h2>Exercises week 1</h2>
            
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <div>
                  <h3>Shapes and Variables</h3>
                  <p>Draw a circle such that the x-position, y-position and the radius are all defined using variables</p>
                  <!-- <script type="text/p5" src="01.js" data-autoplay></script> -->
            </div>

            <div>
                  <h3>Global/Local variables</h3>
                  <p>Create a circle again using variables, however this time define the radius variable inside setup. What happens? the radius variable is defined within another function and is said to be out of scope so it cannot be used 
                        in another function. 
                  </p>
                  <script></script>
            </div>

            <div>
                  <h3>Draw Loop/h3>
                  <p>Draw a circle using variables just as we did in the first exercise, however in this case increment the radius by 0.1 in the draw loop. What happens?</p>
                  <script></script>
            </div>

            <div>
                  <h3>System Variable</h3>
                  <p>A system variable is a variable name which is predefined in the system, draw a shape using the system variables 'height', 'width' and 'frameCount'</p>
                  <script></script>
            </div>

            <div>
                  <h3>Random</h3>
                  <p>Draw a shape, with random size, position and colour. You can either create a variable for each random value globally, or you can create variables for each random value in teh draw function. What happens differently?
                  </p>
                  <script></script>
            </div>

            <h2>Conditionals</h2>

            <div>
                  <h3>If</h3>
                  <p>Draw the left side of the screen black whenever the mouse is on the left side od the screen</p>
                  <script></script>
            </div>

            <div>
                  <h3>If-Else</h3>
                  <p>Do the same as above, however now when the mouse is on the top side of the screen draw the top side blue. What happens in this case? Does the program draw the left side or the top when on the top-right section of the screen
                     To help visualise what is happening, try drawing two line which are in the center vertical and center horizontal. The priority of which conditional statement is dependant on the order of the conditionals. 
                  </p>
                  <script></script>
            </div>

            <div>
                  <h3>Else</h3>
                  <p>Do the same as above again, and now if the mouse is not on the left, and not at the top of the screen, then draw the bottom-right side of the screen red.</p>
                  <script></script>
            </div>

            <div>
                  <h3>Nested If</h3>
                  <p>Using a nested if-statement, first check if the mouse is on the left side of the screen, and then check if the mouse is on the bottom side of the screen. If both conditions pass then colour the bottom-left part of the screen any colour. What do you think is the difference when both of the if-statements are not nested.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div>
                  <h3>Boolean Operations</h3>
                  <p>Try to combine the two if-statements above using boolean operations (and, or, not). Also try to create more conditional statements with the boolean operations. </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                  <h3></h3>
                  <p></p>
            </div>

            <div>
                  <h3>Nested If</h3>
                  <p></p>
