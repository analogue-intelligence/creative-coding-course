            <h2>Basic Canvas</h2>
            <div>
                  <h3>01. Canvas</h3>
                  <p>Create a yellow canvas with a height and width of  100 and 200 pixels, respectively.</p>
                  <script type="text/p5" src="01.js" data-autoplay></script>
            </div>

            <div>
                  <h3>02. Changing shades</h3>
                  <p>Take the canvas you defined in the previous step and now change the shade for the background. <br> Note that the range of shade is between 0 - 255.</p>
                  <script type="text/p5" src="02.js" data-autoplay></script>
            </div>
            <div>
                  <p>Wait! ‚úãüèΩüôà why is the background solid? ü§î <br> Remember that the draw function is called multiple times, therefore let's define the background within the body of the setup function (this is called just once when the program starts).</p>

                  <div>
                        <h3>03. Changing shades 2</h3>
                        <p>Take the canvas you defined in the previous step and now change the shade for the background withing the setup function. <br> Note that the range of shade is between 0 - 255.</p>

            <div>
                  <h3>N. points</h3>
                  <p>Draw three points on the canvas using the following coordinates: Point 1 with x-coordinate 50, and y-coordinate 10, Point 1 with x-coordinate 10, and y-coordinate 90, and Point 1 with x-coordinate 90, and y-coordinate 90</p>

                  <p>Draw a line which cross the canvas starting from the top-left to the bottom-right of the canvas</p>

                  <h3>Rec - CENTER</h3>
                  <p>Draw a rectangle using the CENTER rectangle mode, the rectangle is centred at (50, 50) with width 40, and height 40</p>
                  <script type="text/p5" src="06.js" data-autoplay></script>

            <div>
                  <h3>Rec- CORNER</h3>
                  <p>Draw a rectangle using the CORNER rectangle mode, the top-left corner is at (30, 30) with width 40 and height 50. Note that CORNER is the default rectangle mode</p>

                  <h3>Ellipse - CORNER</h3>
                  <p>Draw an ellipse using the CORNER ellipse mode, the ellipse should be centered at x-coordinate 50, y-coordinate 50 and has length 20 and height 40</p>
                  <script type="text/p5" src="08.js" data-autoplay></script>
            </div>
            <div>
                  <h3>Ellipse - RADIUS and CENTER</h3>
                  <p>Draw two ellipses, both are centred at (50, 50) and both have width 30 and height 30, however one is in CENTER mode while the other is in RADIUS mode. Why are they different? In RADIUS mode the 
                     the width and height of the ellipse are actually half of the width and height, which is why we see the ellipse in RADIUS as twice the size of the on in CENTER mode. Note that CENTER mode is the default mode </p>
