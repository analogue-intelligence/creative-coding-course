                  <h3>3.1.5 System Variable</h3>
                  <p>A system variable is a variable name which is predefined in the system, draw a <code>ellipse</code> using the system variables <code><a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/height" target="_blank" style="cursor:help">height</a></code> (y-coordinate), <code><a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/width" target="_blank" style="cursor:help">width</a></code> (x-coordinate), <code><a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/frameCount" target="_blank" style="cursor:help">frameCount</a></code> (height), and radius 10.</p>

            <div>
                  <h3>3.1.6 Random</h3>
                  <p>Draw a shape, with random size, position and colour. Make sure that the shape is drawn whenever the mouse is pressed. 
                  Make sure to create variables for each random element of the shape. 
                  </p>
                  <script type="text/p5" src="05.js" data-autoplay></script>

            <h2>3.2 Conditionals</h2>

            <div>
                  <h3>3.2.1 If</h3>
                  <p>Draw the left side of the screen red whenever the mouse is on the left side of the screen</p>
                  <script type="text/p5" src="06.js" data-autoplay></script>
            </div>

            <div>
                  <h3>3.2.2 If-Else</h3>
                  <p>Do the same as above, however now when the mouse is on the top side of the screen draw the top side blue. </p>
                  <script type="text/p5" src="07.js" data-autoplay></script>
                  <p>What happens in this case? Does the program draw the left side or the top when on the top-right section of the screen.
                        To help visualise what is happening, try drawing two lines, one which goes through the horizontal center, while another which goes through the vertical center. The priority of which conditional statement is dependent on the order of the conditionals. </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                  <h3>3.2.3 Else</h3>
                  <p>Do the same as above again, and now if the mouse is not on the left, and not at the top of the screen, then draw the bottom-right side of the screen green.</p>
                  <script type="text/p5" src="08.js" data-autoplay></script>
            </div>

            <div>
                  <h3>3.2.4 Nested If</h3>
                  <p>Using a nested if-statement, first check if the mouse is on the left side of the screen, and then check if the mouse is on the bottom side of the screen. If both conditions pass then colour the bottom-left part of the screen any colour.</p>
                  <script type="text/p5" src="09.js" data-autoplay></script>
                  <p> What do you think is the difference when neither if-statements is nested? In this case both conditionals will execute independant of each other.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div>
                  <h3>3.2.5 Boolean Operations</h3>
                  <p>Try to combine the two if-statements above using boolean operations (and, or, not). Also try to create more conditional statements with the boolean operations. </p>
                  <script type="text/p5" src="10.js" data-autoplay></script>
            </div>

            <div>
                  <h3>3.2.6 Your First Grid</h3>
                  <p>Grids are an incredibly useful tool in the creative coding arsenal, helping you organize elements in the canvas. Pixels themselves are arranged in a grid indexed by a row and a column. For this exercise, draw a grid from the top left corner to the bottom right one using what you learned so far about the draw loop and conditionals. It should be possible to define the square size and the padding around the grid.</p>

            </div>

            <div>
                  <h3>3.2.6 Break the Pattern with Random Shapes and Colors</h3>
                  <p>Breaking a pattern helps engaging the viewer. Try modifying the grid you defined in the previous exercise by randomly swapping shapes (e.g. draw a triangle instead of a circle) or colors.</p>
